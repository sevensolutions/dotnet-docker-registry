# üê≥ .NET Docker Registry

A very simple reference implementation of the Docker V2 HTTP API using .NET and Minimal APIs.
It supports `docker push` and `docker pull` commands.
Uploaded artifacts are stored in any S3-compatible backend.

## Getting Started

1. Run a local MinIO instance.
2. Start the server with `dotnet run`.
3. Pull an image with `docker pull alpine`.
4. Retag the image with `docker tag alpine 10.0.1.55:5001/alpine` (where 10.0.1.55 is the IP address where the application is exposed).
5. Push the image with `docker push 10.0.1.55:5001/alpine`.
6. Pull the image with `docker pull 10.0.1.55:5001/alpine`.
